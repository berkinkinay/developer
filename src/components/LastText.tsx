const LAST_TEXT = `Since I started my developer career, Iâ€™ve usually worked on Front-End
development but I can optimize your applications and provide high performance side by side.
I also code and improve my programming skills to build clean structure with elegant code for
Back-End and Server-side development with TypeScript and Node.js. I prefer to use Redux to
manage state during development process. I love writing user interfaces and working on CSS
architecture with clean code. I mostly code React libraries in JavaScript. I prefer the
best UI and UX for users. I love writing user interfaces and working in pure CSS and different CSS libraries
like Styled-Components, SaSS, TailwindCSS architecture with elegant code. I actually like to use
some animation libraries too as well like Framer Motion and PrimeReact, GSAP, barba.js, anime.js etc.`;
